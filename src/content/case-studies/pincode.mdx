## S.T.A.R. Snapshot

**Situation:** Pincode's rapid growth in quick commerce led to fragmented data visibility for sellers and operations, plus a high volume of "Where is my Order?" (WISMO) support tickets.
**Task:** Create a centralized reporting hub and improve order tracking transparency.
**Action:** Launched the 'Seller & Ops Reporting Hub' and a real-time order tracking system.
**Result:** Achieved 99.2% fulfillment rate transparency and significantly reduced WISMO queries.

## Context

In the high-stakes world of quick commerce, visibility is everything. Sellers needed to know their inventory status in real-time, and Ops teams needed to identify bottlenecks immediately. Meanwhile, customers were anxious about their deliveries, driving up support costs.

## The Challenge

1.  **Data Silos:** Critical data was scattered across disparate systems, making it hard to get a "single pane of glass" view.
2.  **Support Volume:** A large percentage of support tickets were simple status checks (WISMO).
3.  **Operational Blindspots:** Delays in the "last mile" were often detected too late to rectify.

## The Solution

### 1. Seller & Ops Reporting Hub
A centralized dashboard serving two key distinct user groups:
- **For Sellers**: Real-time earnings, inventory depletion rates, and return analytics.
- **For Ops Managers**: A comprehensive tool to monitor **order breaches** and **inventory**, empowering them to make data-driven decisions on the ground.

### 2. Post-Checkout & Fulfillment (WISMO Reduction)
Overhauled the post-order experience to streamline communication between the **Rider App** and **End-User**:
- **Live Tracking**: Granular status updates from "Picking" to "Out for Delivery".
- **WISMO Reduction**: Significantly reduced "Where Is My Order" support queries by providing transparent, real-time updates.
- **Proactive Notifications**: SMS/WhatsApp alerts for key milestones.

## Impact

-   **99.2% Fulfillment Rate** visibility achieved for Ops teams.
-   **WISMO Reduction:** Significant drop in order-status related support tickets (implied).
-   **Current Focus:** Continuing to refine high-velocity logistics infrastructure.
