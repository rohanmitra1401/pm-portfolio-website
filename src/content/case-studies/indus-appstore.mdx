# Situation
The **Indus Appstore** launched with a massive library of apps, but user engagement was lower than expected. Users found it difficult to discover relevant apps due to a generic ranking algorithm that didn't account for regional preferences.

# Task
My goal was to **increase the Day-30 (D30) Retention rate** and **App Install conversions** by overhauling the Discovery Pod's recommendation engine. Success would be measured by a lift in retention and a decrease in "search abandonment".

# Action
I led a cross-functional team of 8 engineers and 2 data scientists to implement the following:

- **Scale to 1M+ DAU**: Architected the discovery engine to handle rapid scaling from 0 to over 1 million Daily Active Users at launch.
- **Hyper-Localization**: Championed adoption for **12 regional languages**, breaking entry barriers for non-English speakers and driving deep engagement.
- **Localized Recommendations**: We ingested regional usage data to boost apps popular in specific geolocations (e.g., boosting regional news apps in Kerala).
- **Short Video Feeds**: Introduced a "TikTok-style" feed for app previews, allowing users to see gameplay or app utility before downloading.
- **Micro-Interactions**: Used Framer Motion (like we are using here!) to make the scrolling experience fluid and addictive.

# Result
These changes led to significant wins:

- **27% Lift in D30 Retention**: Users who engaged with the new discovery feed were far more likely to return.
- **12% Increase in Installs**: The video previews conversions significantly.
- **4.8/5 Rating**: The app store rating improved due to better relevance.
