## S.T.A.R. Snapshot

**Situation:** Airtel Business relied on legacy systems for order entry, leading to high manual effort and slow customer onboarding.
**Task:** Modernize the B2B SaaS Order Entry platform and migrate 3,000 enterprise customers to the new stack.
**Action:** Designed a streamlined order entry flow and built automated validation tools for bulk migration.
**Result:** Reduced manual logging from **12 hours to 3 hours (75% gain)** and achieved **80% faster validation** turnaround during migration.

## Context

Airtel Business serves thousands of enterprise customers, but the operational backbone was slowing down growth. The order entry process was manual, prone to errors, and time-consuming. Additionally, legacy customers needed to be migrated to a modern stack to enable new features and better support.

## The Challenge

1.  **Manual Overload:** Sales and Ops teams spent hours manually logging orders.
2.  **Migration Risk:** Moving 3,000 large enterprise accounts carried a high risk of data loss or service disruption.
3.  **Data Integrity:** Ensuring complex B2B plan structures were accurately mapped to the new system.

## The Solution

### 1. B2B SaaS Order Entry Platform
Reimagined the order entry interface to be intuitive and efficient.
-   **Bulk Uploads:** Enabled bulk CSV uploads for large orders, replacing line-by-line entry.
-   **Smart Defaults:** Pre-filled fields based on customer profiles and historical data.
-   **Real-time Validation:** Implemented client-side validation to catch errors before submission.

### 2. Automated Migration Engine
Built a dedicated tool for the migration office.
-   **Automated Mapping:** Scripts to map legacy plan IDs to new SKU structures.
-   **Validation Dashboard:** A visual dashboard for Ops teams to review and approve migration batches, highlighting discrepancies automatically.

## Impact

-   **75% Efficiency Gain**: Reduced manual logging time per order from **12 hours to 3 hours**.
-   **3,000 Enterprise Customers** migrated successfully with zero downtime.
-   **80% Faster Validation**: Drastically improved turnaround time for migrated data validation compared to manual checks.
